# Hitomi 
A demo project for a tiny auto-diff symbolic numerical operation library. 

This project is a school project for course ``Advanced Apps of Machine Learning`` at ``Tsinghua University``

All numerical operations are actually performed by the python lib ``numpy``, the lib ``hitomi`` aims at building symbolic computation
graphs and performing auto differentiation. The core are well designed and concise *(< 1000 lines in total)*. So it can be a good example
for those who are interested in symbolic computation libs.

Finally, it is a demo project, so do NOT use it in production environment.

# Examples
You can find two simple examples in folder ``exampls``.
